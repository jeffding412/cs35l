1. The patch improves the performance of the 'ls' command because the only thing that is being changed by the patch is the removal of a if-statement and having it replaced by what the if-statement contained anyways. Therefore, there will be fewer assembly instructions, thus improving the performance of the code.

2. The patch changes all listed files and directories into non-colored identifiers. The default command highlights folders, files, and executables in different colors. This is something that a company might want to watch out for because it might confuse or disorganize the projects the company is working on.

3. When I ran this script on an empty file like /dev/null, I get the output 'IndexError: list index out of range'. The reason why this happens is because the script raises IndexError if seq is empty.

4. If this script is invoked using Python3 instead of Python2, the script outputs 'SyntaxError: invalid syntax'. The reason why this happens is because the Python 3 changed the automatic tuple unpacking of IOError and merged the parameters in OSError.
