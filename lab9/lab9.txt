First, I got a copy of the Diffutils repository, in Git format, from its main Savannah respository "git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git"

Then, I navigated to the diffutils directory and  got a log of changes to Diffutils' master branch using the "git log" command, amd put it into the file called git-log.txt with the following command "git log > git-log.txt"

Then, I generated a list of tags used for Diffutils using the "git tag" command, and put it into the file called git-tags.txt with the following command "git tag > git-tags.txt"

Then, I found the commit entitled "maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'" in the git-log.txt file and generated a patch for that commit, putting it into the file quote-patch.txt. The commit's ID is 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f. I used the command "git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt" to generate the patch.

Afterwards, I checked out version 3.0 of Diffutils from my repository "git checkout v3.0" using the git-tags.txt file.

I then used the patch command to apply quote-patch.txt to version 3.0 "patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt". In some cases, it wasn't able to figure out what file to patch. I skipped past those by hitting RETURN. The follwing was outputted:

can't find file to patch at input line 35
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?

|    maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
|    
|    This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
|    which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
|    `like this' or ``like this''.

After patching, I used the "git status" command to get an overview of what happened. The following is outputted:

After learning how Emacs function vc-diff (C-x v =) and vc-revert (C-x v u), I used Emacs to revert all the changes to files other than .c files and undid all the changes to .c file other than changes to character string constants. To do this, I went through each none .c modified file and used the command 'C-x v =' and 'C-x v u' commands to revert the files. For the each modified .c file, I used the 'C-x v =' command and the 'C-u C-c C-a' command to revert character string constants if the change is a comment.

Then, I used Emacs to examine the files src/*.c.rej carefully, and manually copied rejected patches into the corresponding .c files as needed.

Then, I removed all untracked files that git status warned me about, since I'm not planning on adding any files into my patch using the command "rm -r *.{rej,orig}" to recursively delete all files containing .rej or .orig. 

After removing all untracked files, git status outputs a half-dozen modified files:

#     modified:   src/cmp.c
#     modified:   src/diff.c
#     modified:   src/diff3.c
#     modified:   src/dir.c
#     modified:   src/sdiff.c
#     modified:   src/util.c

I also ran the command 'git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt'. The output file is 280 lines long.

I then built the resulting mofified version of Diffutils, using the commands described in the file README-hacking. I first ran './bootstrap', added the GNU patch 'patch -p1 < diffutils-gets.diff' after a bit of wget magic, then './configure', 'make', and then 'make check'. I verified that Diffutils does the right things with 'diff . -' and 'diff --help'. The output used ' instead of `, which means the patch worked.

I then did a sanity test using the modified version of Diffutils that I built, by using the just-built diff to compare the source code of Diffutils 3.0 to the source code of my modified version. I put the former source code into a directory diffutils-3.0 and the latter source code into a directory diffutils-3.0-patch, and ran my implementation of diff with the command "D/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt", where the D is the directory containing my diff implementation with the following commands:

mkdir ../diffutils-3.0
cd 
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git diffutils2
cd diffutils2
git checkout v3.0
cp -r src/*.c ../diffutils-3.0/

mkdir ../diffutils-3.0-patch
cp -r src/*.c ../diffutils-3.0-patch/

After running 'diff quote-3.0-test.txt diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt', I can see that the new patch changes the source files with incorrectly commented character-string  s. These difference are innocuous.
